Our mission: Our research seeks to find a balance between social development and the long-term protection of our natural resources.

Hydrogen will play a key role in decarbonizing our society and sustaining our future. Biophotovoltaics (BPV), which exploits the natural oxygenic photosystem in a bioelectrochemcial system, aims to dilver a sustainble solution for hydrogen production in the future. It provides unique benefits in terms of the energy and resource demands and also it can potentially make H2 production as a carbon-sink process since the oxygenic photomicroorganism (e.g. cyanobacteria) use CO2 as the carbon source for growth and maintainance. Within the newly BMBF funded Nachwuchsgruppenprojekt BioPV4H2, we aim to gain a holistic understanding the BPV process from both biological and technological aspects, and thus to promote rational design and development of this technique for future application. To realize the proposed ambitious goals, I am seeking an enthusiastic synthetic biologist to fill a full time postdoc position funded by this project. The main task of this position is to engineer the membrane electron transfer pathways of cyanobacteria in BPV using synthetic biology tools, in order to facilitate the electron transfer rate from the photosystem to the external electron sink.

organisation in Germany, the Helmholtz association. Our mission: Our research
seeks to find a balance between social development and the long-term
protection of our natural resources.

Hydrogen will play a key role in decarbonizing our society and sustaining our
future. Biophotovoltaics (BPV), which exploits the natural oxygenic
photosystem in a bioelectrochemcial system, aims to dilver a sustainble
solution for hydrogen production in the future. It provides unique benefits in
terms of the energy and resource demands and also it can potentially make H2
production as a carbon-sink process since the oxygenic photomicroorganism
(e.g. cyanobacteria) use CO2 as the carbon source for growth and
maintainance. Within the newly BMBF funded Nachwuchsgruppenprojekt
BioPV4H2 , we aim to gain a holistic understanding the BPV process from
both biological and technological aspects, and thus to promote rational design
and development of this technique for future application. To realize the
proposed ambitious goals, I am seeking an enthusiastic synthetic biologist to
fill a full time postdoc position funded by this project. The main task of
this position is to engineer the membrane electron transfer pathways of
cyanobacteria in BPV using synthetic biology tools, in order to facilitate the
electron transfer rate from the photosystem to the external electron sink. The
successfully candidate will have the support to establish and lead the
synthetic biology platform in the group, and will be strongly supported to
develop his/her research profile for the next scientific career move,

PhD position (f/m/d);"The department of Natural Product Biosynthesis (Prof. Dr. Sarah E. O’Connor) at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology invites highly motivated candidates to apply for a

4-year PhD position to study alkaloid biosynthesis, evolution and engineering in medicinal plants (m/f/d).

Project description

Plants produce countless chemically diverse natural products, or specialized metabolites. Alkaloids are a type of natural product that are widely used as medicines. If we discover the biosynthetic genes and enzymes that are responsible for the production of these medicinally important alkaloids, then we can use synthetic biology or engineering approaches to enable better access to these medicines. Ipecac alkaloids have been widely used pharmacological agents for many years. Interestingly, these compounds occur in two evolutionary distant plants suggesting that the biosynthetic pathways evolved independently; in other words, nature developed two different biosynthetic pathways for these molecules.

The aim of this PhD project is to discover the genes of the biosynthetic pathways of ipecac alkaloids in these two distantly related medicinal plant species. Then, the pathways can be compared, contrasted, and recombined using state of the art plant-based production platforms. The PhD candidate will use cutting edge metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches to identify enzyme candidates, screen for activities, characterize active enzymes in vitro and in vivo and reconstitute both natural and synthetic pathways.

Candidate requirements

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with training in biochemistry and molecular biology. Experience and good experimental skills in molecular techniques and mass spectrometry are an advantage. Knowledge about plant natural products, specialized metabolism or biochemistry is desirable but not essential. A Master’s degree (or equivalent) in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Biotechnology or related disciplines is required for this position.

The Max Planck Society is one of Europe's leading research organizations and conducts basic research in the natural sciences, life sciences, and humanities. The Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena carries out fundamental research on how organisms communicate with each other via chemical signals. We analyze ecological interactions with molecular, chemical and neurobiological techniques. In the Institute, organic chemists, biochemists, ecologists, entomologists, behavioral scientists, insect geneticists and physiologists work in collaboration to unravel the complexity of chemical communication that occurs in nature.

The Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology are very committed to equal opportunities, diversity as well as gender equality. We actively support a healthy work-life balance compatibility and the compatibility of work and family and have set ourselves the goal of employing more severely disabled people as well as groups that are underrepresented in science and especially in the given field of activity. Therefore, we explicitly encourage them to apply and welcome applications from all backgrounds.
