About Twist Bioscience

Twist Bioscience synthesizes DNA from scratch, also known as “writing” DNA. Just as children learn to both read and write, the next phase of development for the genomics revolution is the ability to write DNA.

At Twist Bioscience, we work in service of people who are changing the world for the better. In fields such as health care, agriculture, industrial chemicals and data storage, our unique silicon-based DNA Synthesis Platform provides DNA synthesis precision at a scale that is otherwise unavailable to our customers.

CEO for Computational Biology / TechBio Startup;"SynBioCAD is a toolshed for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and industrial biotechnology. The tools and workflows currently shared on the portal enable one to build libraries of strains that produce desired chemical targets covering an end-to-end metabolic pathway design and engineering process. The toolkit lets one do everything from the selection of strains and targets, the design of DNA parts to be assembled, to the generation of scripts driving liquid handlers for plasmid assembly and strain transformations. The software provides a graphical user interface that allows users to drag-and-drop components into a design canvas, and then uses a set of algorithms to automatically generate a corresponding DNA sequence. These features make this tool a valuable addition to a biological engineer’s bench desk, accelerating the development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies

The CEO will be working closely with the inventors of SynBioCAD:

Prof. Jean-Loupe Faulon, scientific director and member of the board

Dr. Joan Hérisson, CTO and member of the board

Recommended experiences for CEO:
• 2+ years of leadership running early-stage ventures
• Technical and commercial understanding of synbio/biotech workflows
• Understanding of the workflow needs from the user’s point of view (Lab technicians, startups, biofoundries)
• Experience in fundraising from institutional investors like private equity, venture capital, foundations, and grants
• Experience in launching and running multiple parallel projects
• Experienced in building market opportunities and working with C-Suite in biotech/synbio companies
• Preferably hold a PhD in Biotechnology or Computer Science (or equivalent). This is not mandatory.
• Most importantly, the candidate must be able to understand and communicate the technology and its value proposition

Responsibilities:
• Manage overall operations, budgeting, and decisions of the organisation.
• Lead the development and execution of the organisation's short and long-term strategy.
• Improve the current product by conducting interviews, collecting user-feedback, and following other well-established PM principles
