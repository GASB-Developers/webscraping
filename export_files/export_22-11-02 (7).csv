"PhD position (Ageing & Disease; Epigenetics & Nuclear Dynamics): High...";Thinking of doing your PhD in the Life Sciences? The International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability is offering talented students the chance to work at the cutting edge of research. As an IPP PhD student, you will join a community of exceptional scientists working on diverse topics ranging from how organisms age or how our DNA is repaired, to how epigenetics regulates cellular identity or neural memory. Activities and responsibilities In the field of “Ageing & Disease”, the research group of Edward Lemke offers the following PhD project: In higher eukaryotes, proteins that lack apparent folded structure are enriched in many vital processes. The Lemke group studies interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and structured proteins in vital cellular processes, such as gene regulation, nuclear transport, host pathogen interactions and healthy aging. Since such highly dynamic systems are inaccessible by most conventional approaches, the group applies a multidisciplinary approach combining single molecule, microfluidics, super-resolution techniques and chemical/synthetic biology tools. PhD project: High Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Protein Plasticity We are now looking for a PhD student with a strong interest in further expanding our efforts in quantitative single molecule and super resolution based technologies to study protein dynamics. The project is particularly well suited for candidates with a strong background in the physical sciences, who are strongly interested in biosciences. However, the project will be highly interdisciplinary, and there are multiple aspects to it, that can be filled by one or two different persons with different interests/backgrounds. In all cases, extensive project training will be provided that candidates with little or even prior no-hands on experience in the experimental biosciences but the strong wish to engage into those are particularly encouraged to apply. High interest and motivation are the main selection criteria and candidates from other disciplines that want to venture into these areas are explicitly welcome to apply. Qualification profile Are you an ambitious, young scientist looking to push the boundaries of science while interacting with colleagues from multiple disciplines and cultures? Then the IPP is your opportunity to give your scientific career a flying start! All you need is: Master or equivalent Interactive personality & good command of English 2 letters of reference For more details on the projects offered and how to apply via our online form, please visit https://www.imb.de/phd We offer Exciting, interdisciplinary projects in a fully international environment, with English as our working language Advanced training in scientific techniques and professional skills Access to our state-of-the-art Core Facilities and their technical expertise Fully funded positions with financing until the completion of your thesis A lively community of more than 190 PhD students from 44 different countries The deadline for applications is 19 November 2022.
