Material Scientist;"What we do

Today, materials production accounts for 23% of GHG emissions and shows no sign of slowing down. Cambrium was founded under the belief that biology offers a better way. For material innovation in nature, biology turns to proteins. Over the past 4.3 billion years evolution has shaped proteins with every material property imaginable. From surfactants and hard surfaces, to gels and foams, to coatings and adhesives. We built our platform to speed up biology’s innovation cycle to make the materials the world needs in a timeline that matters. By programming proteins at scale, we create sustainable breakthrough materials for innovators across cosmetics, fashion and packaging.

We are an equal-opportunity employer and value diversity. We consider all applications equally regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, or gender identity. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech to apply, and we can help with immigration.Your role
