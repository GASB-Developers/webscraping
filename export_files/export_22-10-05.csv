Group Leader – Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.

Your role

Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.

In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems. The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups.

You have

The ambition to work on fundamental biological questions, which implies both, biological discoveries or methodological advances. Furthermore, your research complements and synergizes with the activities of the SCB Unit and the whole of EMBL. You should therefore demonstrate a strong motivation to work in the collaborative and multidisciplinary environment of EMBL.

In addition, you should be dedicated to develop effective relationships and to provide leadership and guidance to team members. The ability to work independently and to participate in a collaborative team effort is desirable, as is a pro-active and positive problem-solving mind-set.

You might also have

EMBL’s new program, Molecules to Ecosystems, includes a vision to advance our understanding of ecosystems at the molecular level, applying expertise in molecular biology to study life in its natural context. New research areas will focus on applying experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to study at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues and populations) how organisms interact with each other and respond to environmental change. SCB will be happy to host structural or molecular systems biology activities related to the new transversal themes.

• Planetary Biology – aiming to understand how microbes, plants, and animals interact with each other and with their abiotic environments at the molecular level.

• Microbial Ecosystems – studying microorganisms, how they live in communities and interact with their environments, including host organisms.

• Infection Biology – unravelling new strategies to treat infections by studying pathogens, their molecular machineries, their interface with the host, and their ability to spread in populations and across hosts.

• Human Ecosystems – applying computational and experimental approaches to reveal the impact of the environment on human health and physiology, both at the individual and the population level.

• Theory – using modelling, mathematical reasoning, and conceptual approaches to study complex and dynamic biological systems.

• Why join us

EMBL appoints group leaders from early on in their career and provides a very supportive environment for your first independent position in order to achieve your research goals. The initial “Lead your Lab” management training is provided for all incoming group leaders.

The SCB Unit at EMBL offers access to an outstanding integrated structural biology environment that includes a particularly well equipped cryo-electron microscopy facility.
