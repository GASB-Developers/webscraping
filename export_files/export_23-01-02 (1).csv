PhD and Postdoc Positions In Materials-directed Synthetic Biology.;"The Department of Synthetic Biology at the University of Freiburg (Research Group Prof. Wilfried Weber) is offering

PhD and Postdoc Positions

In Materials-directed Synthetic Biology.

By using versatile synthetic biology techniques including latest optogenetic approaches, you will develop cell biological and biochemical strategies to synthesize adaptive and interactive materials for different applications including biomedicine, construction, biosensing and bioremediation.

A special focus will be on optogenetic methods to structure material properties in four dimensions by using spatiotemporally controlled illumination as structuring principle.

In this position you will have the opportunity to acquire broad knowledge and experience in two rapidly emerging fields with a strong application potential, engineered living materials as well as molecular optogenetics. You will profit from the broad expertise of one of the leading labs in molecular optogenetics (https://www.optobase.org/fte/?q=*).

You will work in an international, interdisciplinary team using state-of-the-art research facilities. From previous lab members we have seen that experience in the above-mentioned field is a perfect starting point for pursuing an industrial or academic career afterwards.

We are looking for PhD and Postdoc candidates with a background in biochemistry (protein production, purification and modification) or microbial engineering (yeasts, gram-positive bacteria) in the direction of biotechnology.

We are looking forward to your application including CV and publication list. Please send the documents as one single PDF file to wilfried.weber@cibss.uni-freiburg.de
