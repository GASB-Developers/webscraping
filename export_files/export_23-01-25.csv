Optogenetics relies on the engineering of microbial and plant photoreceptors to transduce information in the form of photons into a molecular function, mediated e.g. by a change in protein conformation or enzymatic activity, that is in turn used to control a wide range of cellular processes. In this project, we will systematically design, engineer, and implement light-sensitive switches for the spatiotemporal and quantitative control of mRNA and protein expression, stability, and subcellular localization. In particular, we will apply the optogenetic tools in the fungus Ustilago maydis to study mRNA intracellular transport and mitochondrial function.
Engineering, characterization, and optimization of optogenetic tools for the light-regulated control of gene expression, mRNA and protein stability, and subcellular localization in eukaryotes
Implementation of the optogenetic tools in U. maydis to study mRNA intracellular transport and mitochondrial metabolism and physiology in close collaboration with the Michael Feldbrügge group
