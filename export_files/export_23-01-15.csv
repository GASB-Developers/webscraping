CEO for Computational Biology / TechBio Startup;"SynBioCAD is a toolshed for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and industrial biotechnology. The tools and workflows currently shared on the portal enable one to build libraries of strains that produce desired chemical targets covering an end-to-end metabolic pathway design and engineering process. The toolkit lets one do everything from the selection of strains and targets, the design of DNA parts to be assembled, to the generation of scripts driving liquid handlers for plasmid assembly and strain transformations. The software provides a graphical user interface that allows users to drag-and-drop components into a design canvas, and then uses a set of algorithms to automatically generate a corresponding DNA sequence. These features make this tool a valuable addition to a biological engineer’s bench desk, accelerating the development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies
