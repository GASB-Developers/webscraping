PhD candidate (m/f/d) in Synthetic Biology: mRNA transport and mitochondrial...;The advertised project is integrated into CRC 1535 MibiNet “Microbial networking - from organelles to cross-kingdom communities” and the associated graduate research training group MibiNeⓍt”. In addition to the HHU as the host university, CRC 1535 includes five cooperation partners, including the Research Center Jülich (FZJ), the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH), the University of Bielefeld, the University of Cologne, and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ) in Cologne. Further job offers can be found on our homepage (www.sfb1535.hhu.de). Optogenetics relies on the engineering of microbial and plant photoreceptors to transduce information in the form of photons into a molecular function, mediated e.g. by a change in protein conformation or enzymatic activity, that is in turn used to control a wide range of cellular processes. In this project, we will systematically design, engineer, and implement light-sensitive switches for the spatiotemporal and quantitative control of mRNA and protein expression, stability, and subcellular localization. In particular, we will apply the optogenetic tools in the fungus Ustilago maydis to study mRNA intracellular transport and mitochondrial function. Aufgaben Engineering, characterization, and optimization of optogenetic tools for the light-regulated control of gene expression, mRNA and protein stability, and subcellular localization in eukaryotes Implementation of the optogenetic tools in U. maydis to study mRNA intracellular transport and mitochondrial metabolism and physiology in close collaboration with the Michael Feldbrügge group Qualifikationsprofil A completed scientific university education (M.Sc. / M.A. / Diploma / Magister) in the field of Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, or equivalent fields An excellent academic track record Experimental experience in molecular biology, microbiology, animal cell culture, and/or biochemistry Experience in confocal microscopy would be of advantage Very high motivation for experimental work, independent literature search, and scientific writing A spoken and written command of the English language is desirable Affinity to teamwork Good communication skills and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary exchanges are appreciated Wir bieten Well-balanced 4 years tailored training program with hands-on workshops in state-of-the-art methodology, seminars, and courses in transferable skills International and interdisciplinary research environment with a renowned faculty Excellent training and research infrastructure Comprehensive administrative support for international students The pay scale grouping will be, depending on the personal qualification of the applicant, up to pay grade 13 TV-L.
