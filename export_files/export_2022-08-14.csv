Group Leader - Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"About the team/job

The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.

Your role

Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.

In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems. The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups.

You have

The ambition to work on fundamental biological questions, which implies both, biological discoveries or methodological advances. Furthermore, your research complements and synergizes with the activities of the SCB Unit and the whole of EMBL. You should therefore demonstrate a strong motivation to work in the collaborative and multidisciplinary environment of EMBL.

In addition, you should be dedicated to develop effective relationships and to provide leadership and guidance to team members. The ability to work independently and to participate in a collaborative team effort is desirable, as is a pro-active and positive problem-solving mind-set.

EMBL’s future scientific directions...

EMBL’s new program, Molecules to Ecosystems, includes a vision to advance our understanding of ecosystems at the molecular level, applying expertise in molecular biology to study life in its natural context. New research areas will focus on applying experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to study at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues and populations) how organisms interact with each other and respond to environmental change. SCB will be happy to host structural or molecular systems biology activities related to the new transversal themes.
• Planetary Biology – aiming to understand how microbes, plants, and animals interact with each other and with their abiotic environments at the molecular level.
• Microbial Ecosystems – studying microorganisms, how they live in communities and interact with their environments, including host organisms.
• Infection Biology - unravelling new strategies to treat infections by studying pathogens, their molecular machineries, their interface with the host, and their ability to spread in populations and across hosts.
• Human Ecosystems – applying computational and experimental approaches to reveal the impact of the environment on human health and physiology, both at the individual and the population level.
• Theory – using modelling, mathematical reasoning, and conceptual approaches to study complex and dynamic biological systems.

Project description

Plants produce countless chemically diverse natural products, or specialized metabolites. Alkaloids are a type of natural product that are widely used as medicines. If we discover the biosynthetic genes and enzymes that are responsible for the production of these medicinally important alkaloids, then we can use synthetic biology or engineering approaches to enable better access to these medicines. Ipecac alkaloids have been widely used pharmacological agents for many years. Interestingly, these compounds occur in two evolutionary distant plants suggesting that the biosynthetic pathways evolved independently; in other words, nature developed two different biosynthetic pathways for these molecules. The aim of this PhD project is to discover the genes of the biosynthetic pathways of ipecac alkaloids in these two distantly related medicinal plant species. Then, the pathways can be compared, contrasted, and recombined using state of the art plant-based production platforms. The PhD candidate will use cutting edge metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches to identify enzyme candidates, screen for activities, characterize active enzymes in vitro and in vivo and reconstitute both natural and synthetic pathways";MPI for Chemical Ecology;PhD;"https://www.google.com/search?q=job+offers+synthetic+biology&oq=job+offers+synthetic+biology&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=LrQ99F_o3xYAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail";2022-08-08;2022-08-28;Jena

Postdoc position (m/f/x) on engineering the membrane electron transport...;"The Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) with its 1,100
employees has gained an excellent reputation as an international competence
centre for environmental sciences. We are part of the largest scientific
organisation in Germany, the Helmholtz association. Our mission: Our research
seeks to find a balance between social development and the long-term
protection of our natural resources.

Hydrogen will play a key role in decarbonizing our society and sustaining our
future. Biophotovoltaics (BPV), which exploits the natural oxygenic
photosystem in a bioelectrochemcial system, aims to dilver a sustainble
solution for hydrogen production in the future. It provides unique benefits in
terms of the energy and resource demands and also it can potentially make H2
production as a carbon-sink process since the oxygenic photomicroorganism
(e.g. cyanobacteria) use CO2 as the carbon source for growth and
maintainance. Within the newly BMBF funded Nachwuchsgruppenprojekt
BioPV4H2 , we aim to gain a holistic understanding the BPV process from
both biological and technological aspects, and thus to promote rational design
and development of this technique for future application. To realize the
proposed ambitious goals, I am seeking an enthusiastic synthetic biologist to
fill a full time postdoc position funded by this project. The main task of
this position is to engineer the membrane electron transfer pathways of
cyanobacteria in BPV using synthetic biology tools, in order to facilitate the
electron transfer rate from the photosystem to the external electron sink. The
successfully candidate will have the support to establish and lead the
synthetic biology platform in the group, and will be strongly supported to
develop his/her research profile for the next scientific career move,
including but not limited to further training, international conference and
networking.
