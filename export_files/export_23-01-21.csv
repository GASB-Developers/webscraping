PhD candidate (m/f/d) in Synthetic Biology: synthetic endosymbiosis in...;"The advertised project is integrated into CRC 1535 MibiNet “Microbial networking - from organelles to cross-kingdom communities” and the associated graduate research training group MibiNeⓍt”. In addition to the HHU as the host university, CRC 1535 includes five cooperation partners, including the Research Center Jülich (FZJ), the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH), the University of Bielefeld, the University of Cologne, and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ) in Cologne. Further job offers can be found on our homepage ( www.sfb1535.hhu.de ).

Angomonas deanei is a non-pathogenic trypanosomatid that contains a single proteobacterial endosymbiont. Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized and the symbiont is tightly associated with several host cell glycosomes. Previously, we identified host proteins that apparently control the cell cycle of the endosymbiont. Furthermore, we found that a gene that was transferred from the endosymbiont to the host cell nucleus encodes a metabolic enzyme that now localizes to the endosymbiont-associated glycosome, likely adjusting the metabolic capacity of the glycosome to the needs of the endosymbiont. Aims of the proposed project are 1. to explore host-symbiont metabolic integration with a special focus on the role of the glycosome in this process; 2. to establish advanced optogenetic tools for A. deanei that will be instrumental in scrutiny of host-symbiont interactions; and finally, 3. to establish a synthetic endosymbiosis system in mammalian cells that will allow us to study basic questions regarding host-symbiont interaction (e. g. by reconstructing processes such as nuclear control over endosymbiont division in an orthogonal system).

Development, characterization, and implementation of optogenetic tools (e. g. light-regulated gene expression systems, subcellular localization control) in animal cells and in A. deanei in close collaboration with the group of Eva Nowack at the Institute of Microbial Cell Biology
