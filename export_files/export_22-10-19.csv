"PhD position (Ageing & Disease; Epigenetics & Nuclear Dynamics): High...";Thinking of doing your PhD in the Life Sciences? The International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability is offering talented students the chance to work at the cutting edge of research. As an IPP PhD student, you will join a community of exceptional scientists working on diverse topics ranging from how organisms age or how our DNA is repaired, to how epigenetics regulates cellular identity or neural memory. Activities and responsibilities In the field of “Ageing & Disease”, the research group of Edward Lemke offers the following PhD project: In higher eukaryotes, proteins that lack apparent folded structure are enriched in many vital processes. The Lemke group studies interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and structured proteins in vital cellular processes, such as gene regulation, nuclear transport, host pathogen interactions and healthy aging. Since such highly dynamic systems are inaccessible by most conventional approaches, the group applies a multidisciplinary approach combining single molecule, microfluidics, super-resolution techniques and chemical/synthetic biology tools. PhD project: High Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Protein Plasticity We are now looking for a PhD student with a strong interest in further expanding our efforts in quantitative single molecule and super resolution based technologies to study protein dynamics. The project is particularly well suited for candidates with a strong background in the physical sciences, who are strongly interested in biosciences. However, the project will be highly interdisciplinary, and there are multiple aspects to it, that can be filled by one or two different persons with different interests/backgrounds. In all cases, extensive project training will be provided that candidates with little or even prior no-hands on experience in the experimental biosciences but the strong wish to engage into those are particularly encouraged to apply. High interest and motivation are the main selection criteria and candidates from other disciplines that want to venture into these areas are explicitly welcome to apply.

Group Leader – Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"About the team/job

The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.

Your role

Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.

In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes ; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems . The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups.

You have

The ambition to work on fundamental biological questions, which implies both, biological discoveries or methodological advances. Furthermore, your research complements and synergizes with the activities of the SCB Unit and the whole of EMBL. You should therefore demonstrate a strong motivation to work in the collaborative and multidisciplinary environment of EMBL.

In addition, you should be dedicated to develop effective relationships and to provide leadership and guidance to team members. The ability to work independently and to participate in a collaborative team effort is desirable, as is a pro-active and positive problem-solving mind-set.

EMBL’s future scientific directions…

EMBL’s new program, Molecules to Ecosystems, includes a vision to advance our understanding of ecosystems at the molecular level, applying expertise in molecular biology to study life in its natural context. New research areas will focus on applying experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to study at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues and populations) how organisms interact with each other and respond to environmental change. SCB will be happy to host structural or molecular systems biology activities related to the new transversal themes .
• Planetary Biology – aiming to understand how microbes, plants, and animals interact with each other and with their abiotic environments at the molecular level.
• Microbial Ecosystems – studying microorganisms, how they live in communities and interact with their environments, including host organisms.
• Infection Biology – unravelling new strategies to treat infections by studying pathogens, their molecular machineries, their interface with the host, and their ability to spread in populations and across hosts.
• Human Ecosystems – applying computational and experimental approaches to reveal the impact of the environment on human health and physiology, both at the individual and the population level.
• Theory – using modelling, mathematical reasoning, and conceptual approaches to study complex and dynamic biological systems.

Why join us

EMBL appoints group leaders from early on in their career and provides a very supportive environment for your first independent position in order to achieve your research goals. The initial “Lead your Lab” management training is provided for all incoming group leaders.

The SCB Unit at EMBL offers access to an outstanding integrated structural biology environment that includes a particularly well equipped cryo-electron microscopy facility.

As an inclusive, equal opportunity employer, we believe that diversity enables us to collaborate more effectively and be innovative in our approaches. We are, therefore, committed to creating an inclusive and flexible culture – one where everyone can realise their full potential and make a positive contribution to our organisation.

We encourage applications from individuals who can complement our existing team – we believe that success is built on having teams whose backgrounds and personal experiences reflect the diversity of the populations that our science serves. We actively encourage applications from all genders and cultures, ethnic groups and all demographics to help us avoid perpetuating biases and oversights at this transformational point in our people strategy.

EMBL offers attractive conditions and benefits appropriate to an international research organisation with a very collegial and family-friendly working environment. Competitive salary and social security benefits, financial support for relocation, a relaxed culture, professional development, an on-site nursery, canteen and other staff facilities make EMBL a great place to work.

Postdoctoral Researcher – Synthetic Biology (m,f,d)

Full-time, initially limited to 2 yearsWe are looking for an outstanding individual to drive a visionary synthetic biology project poised to make an impact in oncology. With its emphasis on well-characterized and standardized parts, synthetic biology is considered the engineering approach to building molecular systems. It enables the creation of entirely new molecular functionality in a modular and systematic fashion. The project aims to design intelligent therapeutic gene circuits that can detect and regulate pathophysiological expression of non-coding RNA in tumor cells in a precise and reliable manner. Computational experts in the hosting lab will support the design of those circuits through data analysis, mathematical modeling and machine learning. The project is a joint venture cooperation between TU Darmstadt and Belgian Biotech Studio, eureKASYNBIO (part of the investment company eureKARE) with its special focus on synthetic biology. The selected candidate will be employed by the joint venture and will be located at TU Darmstadt for an initial period of two years. The candidate is given the opportunity to take a leading role in the formation of the envisioned startup company.
