Job description:

The Division of Pediatric Neurooncology offers a total of three postdoctoral positions for two different research groups.

1. Genomic data mining of clinical bulk sequencing

This group led by Dr. Robert J. Autry focuses on developing computational methods and workflows to answer clinically relevant questions across the range of childhood cancers by interrogating genomic and epi-genomic alterations. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cancer predisposition, tumorigenesis and therapeutic response to discover novel therapeutic targets and to improve diagnosis, prevention and clinical outcome in children.

Two postdocs will perform analyses on large-scale bulk genomic sequencing data sets (Whole genome/exome, RNA, methylation, other genomic and epigenomic data types). One position is working on cancer predisposition projects (rare variant burden testing, somatic second hit analysis and collaborations with other institutes). The other postdoc will work on high-grade glioma data to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities in this very high-risk cancer type. Both postdocs will independently manage their own academic research projects, coordinate to meet project deadlines under the mentorship and support of their supervisor. They will also prepare publications, present data both internally and externally, participate in relevant collaborations, and advise and inform other group members on relevant methodology and analytical approaches.

2. Single-cell / spatial genomics data mining

This group led by Dr. Supat Thongjuea aims to understand cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms in childhood cancer. The group focuses on developing and applying computational approaches to analyze single-cell multi-omics and spatial information to uncover patterns and extract relevant knowledge underlying disease mechanisms.

One postdoc will work on data mining and integration of single-cell muti-omics / spatial datasets (RNA-seq, Spatial, ATAC-seq, copy-number and mutational analysis, all at single-cell resolution) including data from longitudinal samples from the same patients generated within the Division of Pediatric Neurooncology. The postdoc will apply existing or develop new computational, statistical, and machine learning techniques to uncover molecular patterns for understanding disease mechanisms (e.g., therapy resistance in cancer). The postdoc will independently manage own academic research, coordinate work to meet project deadlines while receiving mentorship and support from their supervisor. He/she will also prepare research publications and internal/external presentations, participate in relevant collaborations, and act as a source of information and advice to other group members on methodology and analytical approaches.

The Max Planck Society is one of the lead-ing research organizations in Europe. We offer challenging tasks with a high degree of personal responsibility and creative free-dom in research laboratories, workshops, libraries and administration.

The Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research conducts basic research on plants using a wide variety of methods, in particu-lar molecular genetics, genomics, imaging processes, computational biology and bio-chemistry. Our goal is the deep and de-tailed understanding of plant biology in order to improve conventional breeding methods and to develop environmentally friendly crop protection strategies for crops. We focus primarily on the evolution of plants, their genetic blueprint, their de-velopment and their interactions with the environment and microorganisms. How does the plant immune system react to plant pests, for example? How does flower-ing timing depend on seasonally changing day lengths? How does the genetic variabil-ity of crop plants influence adaptation to certain environmental influences? Plant biologists search for the molecular basis of natural diversity of forms in the laboratory, on the computer, in the greenhouse or in the natural environment and thus make innovative contributions to plant breeding.

The Max-Planck society is committed to increasing the number of individuals with disabilities in its

PhD Student Biology - R-loop, RNA Biology (m/f/d);"Are you interested in RNA biology and are looking for a PhD position? Join our newly established research training group (RTG) with a focus on R-loop biology: “4R - R-loop regulation in robustness and resilience”.

Life Science in Mainz has a strong focus on RNA biology, ranging from molecular mechanisms to diagnostics and therapeutics. Many research groups in our scientific community have come across so-called R-loops as important regulatory intermediates in the context of their research. Although it has long been appreciated that RNA can base-pair and hybridize to complementary DNA, it has only recently been appreciated that such RNA-DNA hybrids can have regulatory roles within the genome. When RNA-DNA hybrids lead to the displacement of one strand of DNA, and hence a three stranded structure, it is referred to as an “R-loop”. Indeed, RNA-DNA hybrids and R-loops have recently been demonstrated to influence processes such as transcription, DNA repair and telomere maintenance, which may indicate that R-loops play important roles during ageing. However, when R-loops are not efficiently managed, they can lead to genome instability and disease. Within the “4R RTG”, we will investigate how R-loops regulate biological processes across scales, from molecules to organisms. At the same time the mechanistic regulation of R-loops themselves will be interrogated.

Pending funding, we are currently offering 12 PhD positions, starting on October 1, 2023, to work on various aspects of R-loop biology. Are you an ambitious, young scientist enthusiastic about RNA Biology and looking forward to interacting with colleagues from multiple disciplines and cultures? Then joining our “4R RTG” is your opportunity to give your scientific career a flying start! All you need is:
• Master or equivalent
• Interactive personality & good command of English
• 2 letters of reference
• Exciting, interdisciplinary projects in a vividly international environment, with English as our working language
• Membership within the International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability, a lively community of more than 190 PhD students from 44 different countries
• Advanced training in scientific techniques and professional skills
• Access to our state-of-the-art Core Facilities and their technical expertise
• Fully funded positions with financing until the completion of your thesis

Postdoctoral Fellow;"About the team/job

EMBL Hamburg, as part of the IMAGINE Consortium have been awarded a grant by the European Commission: IMAGINE: Next Generation Imaging Technologies to probe structure and function of biological specimen across scales in their natural context. As part of this funding is a postdoctoral position to work on Work Package 1 of the Imagine Consortium. Work Package 1 targets hard X-ray imaging of biological samples exploring the potential of imaging biological matter in its near native state aiming to develop sample handling techniques and instrumentation to enable routine experiments at both room and cryogenic temperatures and at different X-ray facilities.

Your role

A key focus of this position is the development of the High Throughput Tomography (HiTT) pipeline. This includes the development of sample handling processes, advanced instrumentation and data collection techniques for imaging biological samples. The goal is to produce a streamlined hard X-ray imaging technique pipeline to take a user from an unprepared sample though to a 3D reconstruction of the X-ray data collected on that sample. The development of common sample mounts and/or the ability to transfer samples easily between different facilities will be essential to the collaboration and ensuring compatibility between modalities need also to be explored. Vital to the success of the project is the collaborative spirit between imaging facilities and imaging modalities. All developments will be carried out in such a way that their implementation elsewhere is both possible and expected.

You have

For this role you have:
• A PhD in an area broadly relevant to tissue imaging in biology and/or X-ray instrumentation development.
• An aptitude for both methods and instrumentation development at the physics: biology interface.
• An affinity for collaborative multidisciplinary work.
• A good command of spoken and written English as the working language at EMBL is English.

You might also have

You might also have specific expertise in one or more of the following areas:
• Detailed knowledge and understanding of biological X-ray imaging particularly in relation to its application to soft biological tissue.
• Synchrotron experience and/or experience of X-ray imaging techniques.
• Tissue sample handling and preparation techniques including in one or more of the following areas: X-ray imaging, electron microscopy, light microscopy.
• Computer programming and software development for data analysis (preferably Python and/or C++.
• Experience in 3D Image segmentation.
• Experience using UNIX/Linux command line interfaces and/or cluster based computing resources.
• Experience in using CAD Software.
