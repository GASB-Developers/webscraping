CEO for Synthetic Biology / Biotechnology Startup;"SinFonia aims to produce novel bio-based fluorochemicals in a biological way that is significantly more sustainable than current chemical methods. SinFonia has developed a process to biomanufacture a diverse set of fluorinated molecules, and has filed two patents with a third on the way. Fluorinated organic molecules have the potential to create highly specialised biomaterials or replace current organic synthesis of fluorinated pharmaceuticals

The innovation potential of SinFonia is high, as it sets the stage for a societally sustainable value chain for the production of novel, bio-based fluoropolymers from renewable substrates. Materials containing the element fluorine are extremely important in our modern world, with applications in electronics, healthcare, automotive and wearables. Long term, Sinfonia strives to design cell factories for efficient synthesis of novel fluorinated products.

The CEO will be working closely with the inventors and board of SinFonia:
• Dr. Mariela Paula Mezzina, Chief Scientific Officer
