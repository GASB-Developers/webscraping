The period of employment is governed by the Fixed Term Research Contracts Act (Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz-WissZeitVG). The position offers the chance to obtain further academic qualification (e.g. PhD). Tasks: Coccolithophores, a group of calcifying unicellular eukaryotic algae, are one of the dominant phytoplankton groups of the world's oceans and important players in the carbon cycle due to photosynthetic carbon fixation and the formation of aesthetically shaped CaCO 3 -based cell wall scales called coccoliths. Despite the global impact of coccolithophores, we know little about their physiology at the molecular level. This project will incorporate a combination of genome and transcriptome sequencing and comparative genomics and transcriptomics to identify genes involved in calcification and coccolithogenesis and to guide molecular genetic and synthetic biology approaches for engineering coccolithogenesis. We will interact closely with other laboratories that are specialized in bioinformatics analyses. In this way, the project is poised to make an important contribution to deciphering one of the most important aspects of coccolithophore biology.

Research Assistant

Part-time with 65%
Salary according to salary group 13 TV-L
Ref.: 05096 - gn = gender neutral

The Institute for Physiological Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital of Münster, Germany is offering a position, limited to 3 years, based on a project.

Prof. Seraphine Wegner is currently looking for a motivated PhD candidate with a strong interest in interdisciplinary research in the area of synthetic biology and bottom-up tissue engineering. This project is part of the CRC 1348-Dynamic cellular interphases.

The bottom-up assembly of tissue from cellular building blocks constitutes a promising, yet highly challenging, approach to engineering complex tissues. The challenge lies in controlling cell-cell adhesions and signaling, which determine how cells organize with respect to each other, how they work together, and consequently whether such a multicellular architecture will be functional. We regulate cell to cell adhesions and signaling with visible light using photoswitchable proteins. This optogenetic regulation provides sustainable, non-invasive, dynamic, and reversible control over cell-cell interactions with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. We use these photoswitchable cell-cell interactions to assemble cells into multicellular architectures with predictable and programmable organization. The dynamic and reversible nature of the photoswitchable contacts allows us to locally alter interactions at any point in time, and to rearrange and obtain asymmetric multicellular structures, which are typical of tissues. Finally, we also explore how the photoswitchable cell-cell interactions alter cell behavior and signaling. Ultimately, this will pave the way for the bottom-up assembly of multicellular architectures, enabling us to control precisely and dynamically their organization in space and time as well as regulate how cells work together.
For more detail on the research profile of the group, please see:

Investigation of multicellular architectures
Cell-based assays (ELISA, Western blot, immunofluorescence, cell culture)
Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis
