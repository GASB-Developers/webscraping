Group Leader – Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"About the team/job
The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.
Your role
Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.
In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems. The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups.
You have
The ambition to work on fundamental biological questions, which implies both, biological discoveries or methodological advances. Furthermore, your research complements and synergizes with the activities of the SCB Unit and the whole of EMBL. You should therefore demonstrate a strong motivation to work in the collaborative and multidisciplinary environment of EMBL.
In addition, you should be dedicated to develop effective relationships and to provide leadership and guidance to team members. The ability to work independently and to participate in a collaborative team effort is desirable, as is a pro-active and positive problem-solving mind-set.
EMBL’s future scientific directions…
EMBL’s new program, Molecules to Ecosystems, includes a vision to advance our understanding of ecosystems at the molecular level, applying expertise in molecular biology to study life in its natural context. New research areas will focus on applying experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to study at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues and populations) how organisms interact with each other and respond to environmental change. SCB will be happy to host structural or molecular systems biology activities related to the new transversal themes.

Planetary Biology – aiming to understand how microbes, plants, and animals interact with each other and with their abiotic environments at the molecular level.

Microbial Ecosystems – studying microorganisms, how they live in communities and interact with their environments, including host organisms.

Infection Biology – unravelling new strategies to treat infections by studying pathogens, their molecular machineries, their interface with the host, and their ability to spread in populations and across hosts.

Human Ecosystems – applying computational and experimental approaches to reveal the impact of the environment on human health and physiology, both at the individual and the population level.

Theory – using modelling, mathematical reasoning, and conceptual approaches to study complex and dynamic biological systems.

Why join us
EMBL appoints group leaders from early on in their career and provides a very supportive environment for your first independent position in order to achieve your research goals. The initial “Lead your Lab” management training is provided for all incoming group leaders.

Within the newly BMBF funded Nachwuchsgruppenprojekt BioPV4H2, we aim to gain a holistic understanding of the BPV process from both biological and technological aspects, and thus to promote rational design and development of this technique for future application. To realize the proposed ambitious goals, I am seeking an enthusiastic synthetic biologist to fill a full-time postdoc position funded by this project. The main task of this position is to engineer the membrane electron transfer pathways of cyanobacteria in BPV using synthetic biology tools, in order to facilitate the electron transfer rate from the photosystem to the external electron sink. The successful candidate will have the support to establish and lead the synthetic biology platform in the group, and will be strongly supported to develop his/her research profile for the next scientific career move, including but not limited to further training, international conference and networking.Postdoc position (m/f/x) on engineering the membrane electron transport pathway in Synechocystis Working time: 100% (39 hours per week), expected starting date from January 1st, 2023 but can be discussed upon individual case.

PhD Position (m/f/div) | Alkaloid Biosynthesis, Evolution, and Engineering in Medicinal Plants

The department of Natural Product Biosynthesis (Prof. Dr. Sarah E. O’Connor) at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena invites highly motivated candidates to apply for a three-year PhD position to study alkaloid biosynthesis, evolution, and engineering in medicinal plants.

Project description

Plants produce countless chemically diverse natural products, or specialized metabolites. Alkaloids are a type of natural product that are widely used as medicines. If we discover the biosynthetic genes and enzymes that are responsible for the production of these medicinally important alkaloids, then we can use synthetic biology or engineering approaches to enable better access to these medicines. Ipecac alkaloids have been widely used pharmacological agents for many years. Interestingly, these compounds occur in two evolutionary distant plants suggesting that the biosynthetic pathways evolved independently; in other words, nature developed two different biosynthetic pathways for these molecules.

The aim of this PhD project is to discover the genes of the biosynthetic pathways of ipecac alkaloids in these two distantly related medicinal plant species. Then, the pathways can be compared, contrasted, and recombined using state-of-the-art plant-based production platforms. The PhD candidate will use cutting-edge metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to identify enzyme candidates, screen for activities, characterize active enzymes in vitro and in vivo, and reconstitute both natural and synthetic pathways.

Candidate requirements

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with training in biochemistry and molecular biology. Experience and good experimental skills in molecular techniques and mass spectrometry are an advantage. Knowledge about plant natural products, specialized metabolism, or biochemistry is desirable but not essential. A Master’s degree (or equivalent) in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Biotechnology, or related disciplines is required for this position.

We are offering

a four-year PhD position. Payment will be based on the tariff contracts for the public service (65% TVöD E 13). We provide an excellent research environment with enthusiastic scientists from different nationalities in the department of Natural Product Biosynthesis led by Prof. S. E. O’Connor (www.sarahoconnor.org) at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany (www.ice.mpg.de). The PhD student will be associated with the International Max Planck Research School ( IMPRS , http://imprs.ice.mpg.de).

How to apply

Please send your application as a single PDF in English including a letter of motivation and research interests, CV, relevant certificates (degree certificates etc.), and the name and address of at least one referee to Prof. O’Connor: phd-alkaloid@ice.mpg.de.

Review of applications will begin on August 31st, 2022, and continue until the position is filled. The position is available from October 1st, 2022.

Group Leader – Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.

Your role

Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.

In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems. The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups";EMBL;;"https://www.google.com/search?q=job+offers+synthetic+biology&oq=job+offers+synthetic+biology&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=KwxvJYvEr4UAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail";2022-08-17;2022-09-16;Deutschland
