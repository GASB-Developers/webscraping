of the Julius Maximilian University Würzburg is offering a

Scientist/Postdoc Position

(m/f/d) in Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology

in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Christian Haering. We investigate the mechanisms of molecular machines that organize the three-dimensional organization of eukaryotic genomes by combining molecular cell biology, biochemistry, and structural biology approaches with cellular imaging and single-molecule biophysics techniques. See Shaltiel et al., Science 2022 for an example, or learn more about our research at

What You Will Do:
• Lead an exciting research project based on single-molecule imaging, live-cell microscopy, and protein engineering technologies
• Communicate your research in presentations and publications
• Train students of various disciplines in biochemistry and molecular biology

What We Offer:
• A collaborative, inclusive working environment with a diverse group of scientists
• Access to a cutting-edge research infrastructure
• Participation in career development programs of the JMU Research Academy

What We Expect:
• A Ph.D. degree in the life sciences
• A passion for solving challenging research questions and a dedication to teaching
• Effective verbal and written communication skills
• Experience in advanced light microscopy, protein expression and purification, and/or genome editing in mammalian cells is a plus but not a requisite

The position can be filled in full- or part-time (provided that job sharing ensures that the duties can be performed on a full-time basis) from July 1st, 2023. Appointments are initially limited to three years, with the possibility of an extension. Salary will be based on the pay scale for the public sector in Germany (TV-L).

The JMU Würzburg aims to increase the percentage of women in research and teaching and therefore expressly requests applications from qualified female scientists. Preference will be given to handicapped persons in case of otherwise equal aptitude.

Your application should include a motivation letter, CV, copies of certificates and documents, and the names and contact information for at least two academic referees.
