"PhD position (Ageing & Disease; Epigenetics & Nuclear Dynamics): High...";Thinking of doing your PhD in the Life Sciences? The International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability is offering talented students the chance to work at the cutting edge of research. As an IPP PhD student, you will join a community of exceptional scientists working on diverse topics ranging from how organisms age or how our DNA is repaired, to how epigenetics regulates cellular identity or neural memory. Activities and responsibilities In the field of “Ageing & Disease”, the research group of Edward Lemke offers the following PhD project: In higher eukaryotes, proteins that lack apparent folded structure are enriched in many vital processes. The Lemke group studies interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and structured proteins in vital cellular processes, such as gene regulation, nuclear transport, host pathogen interactions and healthy aging. Since such highly dynamic systems are inaccessible by most conventional approaches, the group applies a multidisciplinary approach combining single molecule, microfluidics, super-resolution techniques and chemical/synthetic biology tools. PhD project: High Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Protein Plasticity We are now looking for a PhD student with a strong interest in further expanding our efforts in quantitative single molecule and super resolution based technologies to study protein dynamics. The project is particularly well suited for candidates with a strong background in the physical sciences, who are strongly interested in biosciences. However, the project will be highly interdisciplinary, and there are multiple aspects to it, that can be filled by one or two different persons with different interests/backgrounds. In all cases, extensive project training will be provided that candidates with little or even prior no-hands on experience in the experimental biosciences but the strong wish to engage into those are particularly encouraged to apply. High interest and motivation are the main selection criteria and candidates from other disciplines that want to venture into these areas are explicitly welcome to apply. Qualification profile Are you an ambitious, young scientist looking to push the boundaries of science while interacting with colleagues from multiple disciplines and cultures? Then the IPP is your opportunity to give your scientific career a flying start! All you need is: Master or equivalent Interactive personality & good command of English 2 letters of reference For more details on the projects offered and how to apply via our online form, please visit https://www.imb.de/phd We offer Exciting, interdisciplinary projects in a fully international environment, with English as our working language Advanced training in scientific techniques and professional skills Access to our state-of-the-art Core Facilities and their technical expertise Fully funded positions with financing until the completion of your thesis A lively community of more than 190 PhD students from 44 different countries The deadline for applications is 19 November 2022.

MetaboArchaea - D-Mannose and D-fructose utilization in members of the Sulfolobales - Significance of the upper Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway Archaea have been established as the third domain of life besides Bacteria and Eukaryotes 42 years ago.
Most cultivable archaeal species are adapted to extreme environmental conditions. These so called 'extremophiles' thrive in hostile habitats characterized by extremes of temperature, pH, salt or combination thereof. Regarding their metabolic complexity Archaea resemble Bacteria and lower Eukaryotes.

However, they are characterized by many new, unusual pathways and enzymes with new regulatory properties, which often share no similarity with their bacterial and eukaryotic counter-parts.

Even the classical generic pathways involved in central carbohydrate metabolism are modified and the degradation of many carbon sources is still unknown.

This offers exciting potential for exploitation in white biotechnology, metabolic engineering as well as synthetic biology but also hampers a profound understanding of archaeal metabolism and physiology.

The overall objective of the proposed project is to decipher the pathways for degradation of D-mannose and D-fructose in S.
solfataricus as well as D-mannose formation and utilization in S. acidocaldarius.

Comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and crude extract measurements will be performed to assist the identification of the respective degradation pathways.
The fate of carbon derived from D-mannose and D-fructose will be studied in S. solfataricus using high resolution 13C-based mass spectrometry in order to unravel the respective metabolic fluxes. The project will be a joint effort with the group of Prof. Dr.

Bettina Siebers at the University of Duisburg-Essen as part of a long-standing collaboration in decoding and studying the central carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharolobus/Sulfolobus spp.
and its regulation.
