Scientist Synthetic Biology/Gene Therapy (m/f/d);"The Position

Are you ready for your next challenge?

Our vision is to create novel and highly differentiated medicines. To this end, we discover and develop novel therapeutic antibodies and next generation biologics, such as bispecific antibodies, fusion proteins or AAV vectors for gene therapy. Our ambition is to deliver such novel molecules to patients with game changing clinical benefit.

We are looking for a Scientist in Synthetic Biology/Gene Therapy (m/f/d) with a keen interest in the fields of rAAV gene therapies. You will join the department of Cell Technologies, which belongs to a unit called Large Molecule Research within Roche Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED).

This position therefore offers the opportunity to interact with numerous functions within Roche also at different sites to deliver novel medicines to patients.

Your team in a nutshell:

You will be part of ambitious matrix teams, which drive different rAAV gene therapy projects of the Synthetic Biology program in Targeted Modalities (TMo). These teams involve Roche colleagues with different expertise and level (e.g. students, lab technicians, scientists and project managers). Each voice is valued and we highly appreciate contribution of different perspectives that often leads to innovative solutions for our challenging projects.

The job in a nutshell:

Your work focuses on development and application of synthetic biology tools for cell engineering and rAAV vector engineering. You have a strong background in ML-guided barcoded library generation & screening to run design-build-test-learn cycles for engineering & optimization of genetic elements.

The main tasks of this position:
• DESIGN: You will design rAAV gene libraries using computational tools based on your deep understanding of how to connect genetic/RNA/protein elements to create synthetic systems that are functional in mammalian cells.
• BUILD: You will apply cutting-edge genome editing and other cell engineering technologies to generate tailor-made cell lines for assays, production and screening.
• TEST: You will use existing and establish new functional readouts, e.g. FACS, reporter cell systems, microfluidic systems and NGS, to select for desired cell populations and isolate desired DNA sequences.
• LEARN: You will use state-of-the-art data analysis software but also apply self-written scripts (e.g. R / Python or others) to analyze and consolidate large data sets that support informed or ML-guided decision-making for the next design cycle.

You will be responsible to map standardized biological parts and process large data sets to fit into our IT infrastructure.

This is also very important for us:

Team player: you are passionate about building strong teams. In your teams, everyone shares the success while setbacks are viewed as an opportunity to learn.Communication and networking: You know how to proactively build bridges and how to network in a big organization.

Being courageous: you tackle difficult issue with confidence and you hold things together during tough times.

Organizational awareness: you see the big picture and have a clear understanding of other groups business needs.

Continuous learning: you enjoy the challenges of unfamiliar tasks to continuously learn new things. You seek novel approaches to solve problems and to challenge the status quo.

Presentation skills: you know how to present in a clear and convincing way in front of big audiences and management boards.

And the technical requirements for this position?
• A strong background in cutting-edge technologies for generation & screening of barcoded libraries is necessary for this position. Ideally in the context of rAAV gene therapies
• A University degree in biotechnology, synthetic biology or similar area including PhD helps you to fulfill those tasks
• Ideally, you have already applied your programming skills to analyze large data sets or have used machine learning approaches to tackle biological questions
• Expertise in molecular biology (e.g. plasmid design, gene switches, RNA engineering, library design & transformation, DNA sequencing) and cell engineering (transfection, CRISPRa/i, gene tagging) is required. Experience in the following techniques and readouts are desired: FACS analysis, microfluidic devices, cell culture automation and NGS
• We can trust in your project management skills
• Fluent English language skills are natural to you
• Strong IT and data analysis skills as well

LSM calls for doctoral applications on a yearly basis, open from the 1st of October until the 30th of November 2022.In this project, parts of the light reactions of photosynthesis from very different species will be combined in a model cyanobacterium by genetic engineering.
The goal is to enhance photosynthesis with respect to its potential to use light from different wavelengths.

In a complementary approach we use adaptive laboratory evolution to make photosynthetic organisms more tolerant against different stresses like for instance high light or high temperature stress.

Corresponding mutations will be identified by whole-genome sequencing, characterized for their molecular effects, and tested for their potential to enhance stress tolerance in several species.

"PhD position (Ageing & Disease; Epigenetics & Nuclear Dynamics): High...";Thinking of doing your PhD in the Life Sciences? The International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability is offering talented students the chance to work at the cutting edge of research. As an IPP PhD student, you will join a community of exceptional scientists working on diverse topics ranging from how organisms age or how our DNA is repaired, to how epigenetics regulates cellular identity or neural memory. Activities and responsibilities In the field of “Ageing & Disease”, the research group of Edward Lemke offers the following PhD project: In higher eukaryotes, proteins that lack apparent folded structure are enriched in many vital processes. The Lemke group studies interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and structured proteins in vital cellular processes, such as gene regulation, nuclear transport, host pathogen interactions and healthy aging. Since such highly dynamic systems are inaccessible by most conventional approaches, the group applies a multidisciplinary approach combining single molecule, microfluidics, super-resolution techniques and chemical/synthetic biology tools. PhD project: High Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Protein Plasticity We are now looking for a PhD student with a strong interest in further expanding our efforts in quantitative single molecule and super resolution based technologies to study protein dynamics. The project is particularly well suited for candidates with a strong background in the physical sciences, who are strongly interested in biosciences. However, the project will be highly interdisciplinary, and there are multiple aspects to it, that can be filled by one or two different persons with different interests/backgrounds. In all cases, extensive project training will be provided that candidates with little or even prior no-hands on experience in the experimental biosciences but the strong wish to engage into those are particularly encouraged to apply. High interest and motivation are the main selection criteria and candidates from other disciplines that want to venture into these areas are explicitly welcome to apply.
