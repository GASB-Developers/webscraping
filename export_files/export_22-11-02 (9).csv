"PhD position (Ageing & Disease; Epigenetics & Nuclear Dynamics): High...";Thinking of doing your PhD in the Life Sciences? The International PhD Programme (IPP) on Gene Regulation, Epigenetics & Genome Stability is offering talented students the chance to work at the cutting edge of research. As an IPP PhD student, you will join a community of exceptional scientists working on diverse topics ranging from how organisms age or how our DNA is repaired, to how epigenetics regulates cellular identity or neural memory. Activities and responsibilities In the field of “Ageing & Disease”, the research group of Edward Lemke offers the following PhD project: In higher eukaryotes, proteins that lack apparent folded structure are enriched in many vital processes. The Lemke group studies interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and structured proteins in vital cellular processes, such as gene regulation, nuclear transport, host pathogen interactions and healthy aging. Since such highly dynamic systems are inaccessible by most conventional approaches, the group applies a multidisciplinary approach combining single molecule, microfluidics, super-resolution techniques and chemical/synthetic biology tools. PhD project: High Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Protein Plasticity We are now looking for a PhD student with a strong interest in further expanding our efforts in quantitative single molecule and super resolution based technologies to study protein dynamics. The project is particularly well suited for candidates with a strong background in the physical sciences, who are strongly interested in biosciences. However, the project will be highly interdisciplinary, and there are multiple aspects to it, that can be filled by one or two different persons with different interests/backgrounds. In all cases, extensive project training will be provided that candidates with little or even prior no-hands on experience in the experimental biosciences but the strong wish to engage into those are particularly encouraged to apply. High interest and motivation are the main selection criteria and candidates from other disciplines that want to venture into these areas are explicitly welcome to apply. Qualification profile Are you an ambitious, young scientist looking to push the boundaries of science while interacting with colleagues from multiple disciplines and cultures?

MetaboArchaea - D-Mannose and D-fructose utilization in members of the Sulfolobales - Significance of the upper Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathwayArchaea have been established as the third domain of life besides Bacteria and Eukaryotes 42 years ago. Most cultivable archaeal species are adapted to extreme environmental conditions. These so called ‘extremophiles’ thrive in hostile habitats characterized by extremes of temperature, pH, salt or combination thereof. Regarding their metabolic complexity Archaea resemble Bacteria and lower Eukaryotes. However, they are characterized by many new, unusual pathways and enzymes with new regulatory properties, which often share no similarity with their bacterial and eukaryotic counter-parts. Even the classical generic pathways involved in central carbohydrate metabolism are modified and the degradation of many carbon sources is still unknown. This offers exciting potential for exploitation in white biotechnology, metabolic engineering as well as synthetic biology but also hampers a profound understanding of archaeal metabolism and physiology.
The overall objective of the proposed project is to decipher the pathways for degradation of D-mannose and D-fructose in S. solfataricus as well as D-mannose formation and utilization in S. acidocaldarius. Comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and crude extract measurements will be performed to assist the identification of the respective degradation pathways. The fate of carbon derived from D-mannose and D-fructose will be studied in S. solfataricus using high resolution 13C-based mass spectrometry in order to unravel the respective metabolic fluxes. The project will be a joint effort with the group of Prof. Dr. Bettina Siebers at the University of Duisburg-Essen as part of a long-standing collaboration in decoding and studying the central carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharolobus/Sulfolobus spp. and its regulation.

Group Leader – Structural or Molecular Systems Biology;"About the team/job

The Structural and Computational Biology (SCB) Unit at EMBL Heidelberg pursues an ambitious and cross-disciplinary research program in integrated structural and computational systems biology, bridging between temporal and spatial scales. The SCB Unit seeks to recruit a highly motivated group leader in the area of structural or molecular systems biology to address fundamental questions in life sciences.

Your role

Establish an independent and innovative research programme. The SCB Unit is interested in attracting candidates that pursue experimental or computational approaches, which can contribute to or interface with integrated structural biology. Research areas can be diverse including chemical biology, (high-throughput) biochemistry, biophysics, proteomics, metabolomics, synthetic biology, modelling and simulation of biological systems. The research should extend or enrich structural systems biology, a broad concept that the unit is pursuing, in conjunction with a strong computational biology programme.

In line with EMBL’s scientific programme from Molecules to Ecosystems, the SCB Unit is also interested in candidates that have research programs related to EMBL’s transversal themes; for example, the SCB Unit has already considerable strengths in Planetary Biology and Microbial Ecosystems. The future group leader will be embedded in the multidisciplinary and collaborative environment of EMBL, which provides many opportunities for interaction with other research groups.

You have

The ambition to work on fundamental biological questions, which implies both, biological discoveries or methodological advances. Furthermore, your research complements and synergizes with the activities of the SCB Unit and the whole of EMBL. You should therefore demonstrate a strong motivation to work in the collaborative and multidisciplinary environment of EMBL.

In addition, you should be dedicated to develop effective relationships and to provide leadership and guidance to team members. The ability to work independently and to participate in a collaborative team effort is desirable, as is a pro-active and positive problem-solving mind-set.

EMBL’s future scientific directions…

EMBL’s new program, Molecules to Ecosystems, includes a vision to advance our understanding of ecosystems at the molecular level, applying expertise in molecular biology to study life in its natural context. New research areas will focus on applying experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to study at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues and populations) how organisms interact with each other and respond to environmental change. SCB will be happy to host structural or molecular systems biology activities related to the new transversal themes.
• Planetary Biology – aiming to understand how microbes, plants, and animals interact with each other and with their abiotic environments at the molecular level.
• Microbial Ecosystems – studying microorganisms, how they live in communities and interact with their environments, including host organisms.
• Infection Biology – unravelling new strategies to treat infections by studying pathogens, their molecular machineries, their interface with the host, and their ability to spread in populations and across hosts.
• Human Ecosystems – applying computational and experimental approaches to reveal the impact of the environment on human health and physiology, both at the individual and the population level.
• Theory – using modelling, mathematical reasoning, and conceptual approaches to study complex and dynamic biological systems.

Why join us

EMBL appoints group leaders from early on in their career and provides a very supportive environment for your first independent position in order to achieve your research goals. The initial “Lead your Lab” management training is provided for all incoming group leaders.
